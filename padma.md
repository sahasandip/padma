Padma River is the downstream of the Ganges, more precisely, the combined
flow of the Ganges and the Jamuna after their confluence at Goalandaghat.
In Bangladesh the Ganges is popularly known as the Padma from its point
of entrance at Manakosa and Durlabhpur unions of Shibganj upazila,
Chapainawabganj district. This name (Padma or Podda) is sometimes applied
to the Ganges as far up as the point at which the Bhagirathi leaves its
rightbank, and according to the Hindus, it takes the sanctity of the
Ganges with it. It is hydrographically more correct to use the name 
Ganges to refer to the river up to its confluence with the Jamuna 
(Brahmaputra), and the downstream after the confluence as the Padma. 
The Padma is also sometimes wrongly referred to as the Ganges. The 
river between Aricha and Sureshwar (Chandpur) is therefore best called
Padma. 1st change by asheka
